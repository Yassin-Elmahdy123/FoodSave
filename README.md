# FoodSave Website
## Describtion
This is a project that demonstrates a model of an idea that came up to my mind. This idea is to make a website that encourages people to save food and aware them about the problem of food waste and including a causes, impacts, and possible solutions for the problem. Finally, it demonstrates an exciting solution that I thought of which is a point system that encourages people to not waste food to gain more points that they can replace it with copouns in food ordering apps or donate money to food banks using this points.
## Usage
1. Open the demo link of the project.
2. Navigate between the different pages.
3. read the content of each page to get the idea of the website.
## AI role
AI only helped me in constructing the skeleton and the overall shape of the website and the navigation system between the pages. However, I edited the AI's code to add the content of the website and added different pictures in each section.
